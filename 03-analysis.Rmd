# Analysis {#analysis}

Carrying out a comprehensive Principal Component Analysis is both an art and a science. The analyst must have some degree of analytical experience as well as a reasonable familiarity with the analyzed data. A rushed PCA analysis tends to lead to confusing results, and frustating endeavors. A well applied PCA involves a certain strategy to analyze the data, enforced with common sense, and taking certain precautions.

In this chapter, we present a methodology to carry out a Principal Component Analysis that goes above and beyond what is typically discussed in other texts about PCA. We try to stay away from the narrow perspective of using PCA within with the sole purpose of wroking with few variables that are compatible with a statistical model. Instead, we strongly advocate for analyses that take into account as many variables as possible. This will make the analysis richer, more _holistic_, and with more coherent interpretations.


## Themescope

We are assuming that the data you are working with comes from a context of great _data diversity_. For example, data from surveys or questionnaires, or from a database of clients, in which there is an abundance of different types of variables.

In these cases with a rich variety of variables, we can group those variables in __themes__. Each theme defining a point of view or _multivariate reality_. For instance, when we have a group of socio-economic variables, or when a set of variables have to do with preferences about a set of products. By refer to this approach as __themescope__, that is, a multidimensional description by themes.

The analysis strategy that we propose is to analyze individuals by themes. This involves selecting a particular theme in which the variables associated to it become the active variables. Having a group of active variables, we study the resemblances of the individuals according to this point of view. And then we add all the available information that has not been utilized, but that can shed some light in better understanding the relationship between individuals and variables, by using the projection of supplementary elements.

```


#### Various Perspectives, Diverse Analyses {-}

When selecting a particular active theme, this does not stop us from selecting another theme that can then become active in itself. By changing active themes, we have a different perspective of the analyzed data, in analogous way to taking photos of the same subject from different angles.



## Conditions of Application

### Linearity and Symmetry

We have seen the importance of the correlation coefficient (or covariance) in PCA. We can actually present PCA as a visualization technique of a correlation matrix (or coavraince matrix). The technique will excel when the correlation coefficient is a _good_ measure of the association between variables. The ideal conditions to apply PCA are when the association among avriables are linear and their distributions are symmetric (i.e. closer to the normal distribution).

Consequently, we need to be cautious when the distributions are extremely asymmetric or when the associations among variables are not linear.

A common case that can limit the applicability of PCA is when analyzing variables that are seemingly continuous, but that in reality are a hybrid of continuous and nominal scale. For example, this is the case of variables like _payed work time_ of women: this is null for a woman that is a housewife, while the distribution is continuous for women that have a payed job.

Nonlinearity associations can also limit the applicability of PCA. This is illustrated with the relation betwen age and income: overall, income tends to increase with age during active working years, but when a person retires the income tend to decrease.

Phenomena of lack of symmetry and lack of linearity will affect the results of a PCA. If these issues are not indentify, they can lead to wrong interpretations and conclusions. However, the presence of these phenomena will become apparent for the well trained eyes of an experienced analyst.

We should say that techniques such as Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) can always be used after having encoded (categorized) the continuous variables. Compared to PCA, MCA has the advantage of being inherently non-linear, and thus can be used in situations when PCA is limited.



### Balancing the content of active variables

More often than not, Principal Component Analysis is performed on variables having different units of measurement. In this case, the variances tend to be vary considerable in magnitude, and are not directly comparable. The typical solution to overcome this issue is to rescale the variables in standard units (i.e. mean of zero, unit variance). In this way, all variables wil be given the same importance, and we don't have to worry about units of measurement anymore. In fact, this type of transformation has become the default solution in most PCA computer programs: to carry out a normalized PCA and work on the matrix of correlations. Keep in mind that this transformation modifies the shape of the cloud of points by providing the same spread among all directions in the space of origin.

Despite the usefulness of transforming variables into standardized scale, this transformation is not always the ideal solution to _balance_ the variables. For example, if thre is a subset of variables that are highly correlated among each other, this subset will dominate the first principal component, and therefore, will have a higher importance in the analysis.

Suppose that you have 5 variables that are measuring the same aspect of a certain phenomenon, and that the other aspects are covered each one by just one variable. You can think of the group of 5 variables as being just one variable but with a variance 5 times larger than the rest of the variables. Consequently, the first axis will be determined by the cumulative effect of the 5 highly correlated variables. In summary, we should pay attention to the effect produced by groups of variables that are highly correlated, and have a mechanism to balance the importance of each aspect in the studied phenomeno.



## Validation: stability and significance

What is the part in PCA results that is not really accounted by the structure of the data, but by the randomness in the data? Are the results stables and reproducibles? Do the configuration of points change based on the studied data? All of these questions make it necessary to assess the stability of the obtained results.

The stability of the results will depend on the randomness of the data collection process (e.g. random samples, sampling surveys), as well as on the measurement errors in the variables.


### How many axes to study and retain?

Are the directions of the first axes will defined and stable? More precisely, are the dispersions in consecutive directions really different? If not, we would have to consider that the factorial plane formed by them is stable but the associated axes are not really different (i.e. indeterminate by a rotation).

One way to answer these questions is to suppose that the data come from a sample drawn from a population with a normal distribution. In this case, the eigenvalues asymptotically follow a normal distribution (Anderson, 1963). The, we can estimate a 95% confidence interval for each eigenvalue with the formula \@ref(eq:31)

\begin{equation}
\left [ \lambda_{\alpha} \left (1 - 1.96 \sqrt{2/(n-1)} \right ); \hspace{1mm} \lambda_{\alpha} \left (1+1.96\sqrt{2/(n-1)} \right) \right ]
(\#eq:31)
\end{equation}

The width of this interval gives us an idea of the stability of the eigenvalue with respect to the sample randomness. The overlapping in the intervals of two consecutive eigenvalues suggests that these eigenvalues are equal (or very similar). The corresponding axes are thus indeterminate by one rotation. Under this situation, the analyst should focus on the interpretation of the subspace defined by the first eigenvalues that are well separated.

Although this result has to do with eigenvalues of covarance matrices, it can also be applied to the eigenvalues of correlation matrices. Simulation studies show that the confidence intervals tend to be "cautious": the coverage percentage of the true eigenvalue, is almost always greater than the anounced confidence level. In any case, the asymptotic nature of the results, and the underlying hypothesis of normality, lead us to consider the results are merely indicative (not a hard rule).

In regards of the factorial axes, it is convenient to distinguish the axes that will be studied, from the axes that will be used. The factorial axes can be seen as an ultimate result, or also as an intermediate stage for further studies.

For example, a PCA can be a preliminary stage before performing a discriminant analysis. In this case, we will try to use the axes with discriminant power, which may not coincide with the axes of largest spread.

If the goal is to classify individuals, it makes sense to retain only the axes expressing real directions of spread, in order to preserve the stable characteristics of the individuals, while excluding those directions that are mainly capturing random noise.


#### Scree Test (Cattell's rule, 1966) {-}

One of the most prevalent questions in PCA is "how many principal components (or factorial axes) to retain?" Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to this question.

If we assume that the $n$ values taken by the $p$ variables come from a random process that uniformly fills up the space, without privileging any direction, then the $p$ eigenvalues of the PCA will slowly decrease in a regular form.

If a PCA provides a histogram of the eigenvalues showing one or more staircase steps, we can think that there are sufficiently strong associations between the variables. These associations would be responsible for the appearance of directions or subspaces where most of the dispersion is concentrated.

Such pragmatic considerations, can be used to determine---in a more or less subjective way---a minimum and a maximum number of axes to retain in the analysis. The main way to do this is through visual inspection of the histogram of eigenvalues following the so-called _scree test_ or _elbow criteria_ proposed by Raymond Cattell (1966). This criteria, which is the simplest and oldest one, involves graphing a line plot of the eigenvalues, ordered from largest to smallest, and then look for the "elbow" of the graph where the eigenvalues seem to level off. 

In the example of the cities (first PCA), we obtained the following eigenvalues:

```{r table-3-1, echo = FALSE}
# table of eigenvalues
eigs <- read.csv('data/eigenvalues.csv', row.names = 1)

knitr::kable(
  eigs,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Distribution of eigenvalues in 1st PCA.'
)
```

<br>

We can then plot a histogram of the eigenvales, and add a line connecting the heights of the bars to better see the way in which the sizes of the eigenvalues decrease:

```{r echo = FALSE}
load("data/pca1.RData")
scree1 <- barplot(
  pca$eig[,1], col = 'gray80', border = NA, las = 1, 
  names.arg = 1:nrow(pca$eig), xlab = "eigenvalues",
  main = "Scree plot (PCA 1, table 2.1)")
lines(scree1[,1], pca$eig[,1], lwd = 2.5, col = "#4286f4")
```


In the second PCA of the salaries divided by the mean salary of a city, we obtained the following eigenvalues:

```{r table-3-2, echo = FALSE}
# table of eigenvalues
eigs2 <- read.csv('data/table-2-7.csv', row.names = 1)

knitr::kable(
  eigs2,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Distribution of eigenvalues in 2nd PCA.'
)
```

<br>

Graphing the scree plot we obtain the following display:

```{r echo = FALSE}
scree2 <- barplot(
  eigs2[,2], col = 'gray80', border = NA, las = 1, 
  names.arg = 1:nrow(eigs2), xlab = "eigenvalues",
  main = "Scree plot (PCA 2, table 2.7)")
lines(scree2[,1], eigs2[,2], lwd = 2.5, col = "#4286f4")
```


More formally, Cattell's criteria consist of sorting the lagged differences of second order between eigenvalues, as follows:

\begin{equation}
d(\alpha) = (\lambda_{\alpha + 1} - \lambda_{\alpha}) - (\lambda_{\alpha} - \lambda_{\alpha - 1})
(\#eq:32)
\end{equation}


The reason why is called _scree test_ has to do with the metaphor of a mountain scree. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree), a "scree is a collection of broken rock fragments at the base of crags, mountain cliffs, volcanoes or valley shoulders that has accumulated through periodic rockfall from adjacent cliff faces."

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/scree-mountain.png")
```



#### Note {-}

We have seen that when there is a _size effect_ in the first axis, the subsequent eigenvalues are affected and reduced. However, it is possible that subsequent eigenvalues reflect structural oppositions. This is the case of of the second PCA on raw data, which corresponds approximately, to the first axis of the analysis on the ratio data, when the size effect is eliminated.

On the other hands, it is risky to interpret the percentage of inertia as a measure of the information contained in an axis. This percentage can be made as small as possible, just by adding independent random variables to the data of active variables. The overall inertia will increase, while the "information" contained in the first axes will remain the same and, consequently, the percentage of inertia in each axis will decrease.

```{r table-3-3, echo = FALSE}
# table of eigenvalues
table_3_3 <- read.csv('data/table-3-3.csv')

knitr::kable(
  table_3_3,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Distribution of eigenvalues from data with random perturbations.'
)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
scree3 <- barplot(
  table_3_3[,2], col = 'gray80', border = NA, las = 1, 
  names.arg = 1:nrow(table_3_3), xlab = "eigenvalues",
  main = "Scree plot (random perturbations)")
lines(scree3[,1], table_3_3[,2], lwd = 2.5, col = "#4286f4")
```


### Simulations, random effects on individuals

One way to assess the stability of results involves using the available information in the data, via computational methods to run some simulations. By following this type of approaches, we are able to free ourselves from the probabilistic assupmtions about the data, which are seldom met when dealing with multivariate data.

The strategy that we use is based on random perturbations of the data, in order to simulate a certain natural variability or measurement error in the observations.

Each observation in the data matrix is replaced by the observed value ples a random quantity that follows a normal distribution with mean and variance depending on the variable under modification.

We denote this change of value as:

\begin{equation}
x_{ij} = x_{ij} + N(x_{ij}, Ks_j)
(\#eq:33)
\end{equation}

The observed value $x_{ij}$ is modified by adding a random quantity that follows a normal distribution, centered at $x_{ij}$, and with standard deviation $K$ times the standard deviation $s_j$ of variable $j$.

The value of the constant $K$ determines the amount of perturbation that we introduce in the data. $K=0$ indicates that the observations remain unchanged. A value of $K=1$ means that each observation is affected, on average, one standard deviation.

Once we have modified the data table, we can perform a PCA, calculate its directions, the correlation of the extracted directions with the original-unmodified variables, obtaining a matrix of correlations between axis systems.

In this matrix we will inspect, for each original axis, what other modified axes are most correlated with. We will also check if an axis is correlated with all other axes in analogous way. In the former case, this indicates that an axis is stable, despite the random modifications in the data. In the latter case, this indicates that an axis is the result of randomness in the data.

By looking at the matrix of correlations described in the previous paragraph, we can detect up to what extent the rank of the axes are stables, and from what point the "natural" random fluctuations in data begin.

In the example of the international cities, we show in table (TABLE 3.4) the correlation matrices between the axes (in rows) obtained in the analysis of ratios (salaries of professions with respect to the mean salary of the city) and the axes obtained with a random perturbation of 1%, 5% and 10% of the standard deviation of each variable.


```{r table-3-4a, echo = FALSE}
# perturbation 1%
perturb1 <- read.csv('data/table-3-4a.csv', check.names = FALSE)

knitr::kable(
  perturb1,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Assessment of random perturbations (rows correspond to axes of 2nd PCA).'
)
```

__Perturbation of 5%__

```{r table-3-4b, echo = FALSE}
# perturbation 5%
perturb2 <- read.csv('data/table-3-4b.csv', check.names = FALSE)

knitr::kable(
  perturb2
)
```

__Perturbation of 10%__

```{r table-3-4c, echo = FALSE}
# perturbation 10%
perturb3 <- read.csv('data/table-3-4c.csv', check.names = FALSE)

knitr::kable(
  perturb3
)
```

<br>

By looking at the diagonal of the tables, we observe stability in the first factor, as well as in the second and the third factors, up to a random perturbation of 5% of the original standard deviation. With a high perturbation (of 10%) only the first factor is resistant to the modifications.

Table \@ref(tab:table-3-5) displays the mean and standard deviation of the salary variables (gross salary divided by the city-mean salary), as well as the correlation between the randomly modified variable and the original variable. We can tell that with a random perturbation of 10% the standard deviations increase, while the correlations decrease.

```{r table-3-5, echo = FALSE}
# perturbation 1%
table_3_5 <- read.csv('data/table-3-5.csv', check.names = FALSE)

knitr::kable(
  table_3_5,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Summary Statistics of Active Variables affected by random perturbations.'
)
```


### Bootstrap Simulations

Another way of empirical assessment can be done using random resampling methods on the data. The idea is to obtain a number of data tables, all of the same dimension as the original one, by randomly sampling with replacement the observations in the data. This approach is the so-called Bootstrap method (Efron et al, 1993). Following this approach, it is possible to estimate the sampling errors and the distribution of the various PCA results.

How to implement the bootstrap method? First, we form a large number of samples of $n$ individuals which are drawn with replacement from the $n$ original individuals in the data. This set of samples is referred to as the _bootstrap samples_. For each bootstrap sample, some of the original individuals won't be part of the sample, while some individuals may appear more than once in the sample. Each bootstrap sample gives place to a data table.

On each of the bootstrap tables we calculate its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We then obtain a bootstrap distribution of the eigenvalues, as well as the bootstrap distribution of the correlations between the eigenvectors and the original axes.

For each eigenvalue we can obtain a confidence interval. Likewise, for each eigenvector we can obtain a confidence cone around the original eigenvector. Examining the correlation between the axes can then reveal potential rotations among axes.

The bootstrap simulations can also be used to assess the stability of the projections of the variables and the categories. We can position the different bootstrap tables as supplementary information in the analysis of the original table (Lebart et al, 1995). In this way, it is possible to visualize in the factorial planes regions of "natural" fluctuation of the different elements in the data table.



## Analysis of Table of Ranks

In PCA, it is assumed that the variables are measured on a continuous scale. When applying a normalized PCA, the results will depend on the matrix of correlations between variables. Such results can be affected by the presence of outliers or atypical observations.

One approach to make the results independent from the scale of measurement and monotone transformations, consists of working with the _ranks_ of the variables and not with the actual observed values.

To do that, we substitute each value by its rank in increasing order, depending on the considered variable. By doing this, the active table becomes a table of ranks, and consequently, the PCA is performed on a correlation matrix of ranks. This is a remarkable feature of PCA: it is a general methodology that can be applied on any correlation matrix defined by the analyst.

One interesting transformation involves working with the Spearman's correlation coefficients. This coefficient measures the monotone dependency between the rank values of two variables according to the following formula:

\begin{equation}
r_s (j, j') = 1 - \frac{6 \sum_{i}^{n} (x_{ij} - x_{ij'})^2}{n (n^2 - 1)}
(\#eq:34)
\end{equation}

where the quantities $x_{ij}$ represent the rank of the individual $i$ of the $j$ variable. The advantage of the Spearman's correlation coefficient is that it coincides with the Pearson's coeffcient (usual correlation) when applied to a matrix of ranks.

In the case of the international cities, the Spearman's correlations are given in table \@ref(tab:table-3-6) (compare these with table \@ref(tab:table-2-6)).

```{r table-3-6, echo = FALSE, comment = ''}
load('data/table-3-6.RData')
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

# print table with kable
knitr::kable(
  table_3_6,
  
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = "Spearman's Rank Correlation Matrix (variables from 2nd analysis)"
)
```

<br>

We apply a PCA on the matrix of Spearman's correlations. The eigenvalues are depicted in table \@ref(tab:table-3-7) which can be compared to those of table \@ref(tab:table-2-7).

```{r table-3-7, echo = FALSE}
# table of eigenvalues
load('data/table-3-7.RData')

knitr::kable(
  table_3_7,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Distribution of eigenvalues (from table of ranks).'
)
```

<br>

Likewise, table \@ref(tab:table-3-8) displays the results obtained for the ranks of the active variables.

```{r table-3-8, echo = FALSE}
# table of eigenvalues
load('data/table-3-8.RData')

knitr::kable(
  table_3_8,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'PCA results of table of ranks'
)
```

<br>

The cloud of points is depicted in figure \@ref(fig:fig-3-2). The configuration of this cloud is similar to the initial cloud displayed in figure \@ref(fig:fig-2-9). The similarity of the results obtained with the table of ratios confirms the good quality of the performed analysis. Also, this similarity shows that the essential information is contained in the rank of the values, and not so much in the observed eigenvalues.

```{r fig-3-2, echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='Circle of correlations on the first factorial plane of the second analysis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure-3-2.png")
```

The fact that the cloud of points in figure \@ref(fig:fig-3-2) is similar to the graph \@ref(fig:fig-2-9), indicates that the visual displays do not depend on: the units of measurement, monotone transformations, or possible existance of outliers. Hence, we can say that the observed configurations are _robusts_.

In the absence of robust configurations, we can suggest positioning the elements of the original table as supplementary elements in the analysis of ranks, in order to detect whether there are sensible elements.

Sometimes it is convenient to work with variables that have distributions close to a normal distribution. In this case, each variables con be handled as having a normal distribution with expected value equal to the observation of rank $k$, instead of working directly with the ranks (Lebart et al, 1977).



## Optimal Reconstitution of Data

Principal Component Analysis allows us to approximate a data matrix, generally of column-rank $p$, a matrix of lower rank defined by the first eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors.

The formula \@ref(eq:35), referred to as the singular value decompoisition (SVD), lets us approximate the original values $x_{ij}$ with a factorization of some set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In other words, we can obtain an approximate reconstitution of the data values by using only a few $q$ values and vectors from the SVD.

\begin{equation}
\hat{x}^{q}_{ij} = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{q} \sqrt{\lambda_{\alpha}} \hspace{1mm} v_{i\alpha} u_{j\alpha}
(\#eq:35)
\end{equation}

The term $\hat{x}^{q}_{ij}$ is an approximation of the observed value $x_{ij}$ from a small set of coefficients calculated from a PCA: the eigenvalues $\lambda_{\alpha}$, the eigenvectors $v_{i\alpha}$ and $u_{j\alpha}$, of rank 1 to $q$.

This reconstitution is optimal in the sense that it provides the best least-squares approximation of the original matrix: minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the observed values and the approximated values (for all $q$):

$$
min \left \{ \sum_{i} \sum_{j} (x_{ij} - \hat{x}_{ij}^{q})^2 \right \}
$$

It can be proved that:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i} \sum_{j} (x_{ij} - \hat{x}^{q}_{ij})^2 = \sum_{\alpha = q+1}^{p} \lambda_{\alpha}
(\#eq:36)
\end{equation}

The sum of the $p-q$ excluded eigenvalues measures the amount of error when approximating the original cloud of points by its projection onto a subspace of dimension $q$.

This property is of great practical application. It justifies the utilization of PCA in a data compression problem (for example, in the reconstitution of images, and also in data transmission).



## Synthetic Variables and Indices

So far we have discussed Principal Component Analysis from a purely geometric perspective: how to obtain a subspace that best approximates the original distances of the data elements.

Interestingly, PCA can also be seen from other points of views. One of them involves the idea of looking for a small set of new variables---formed by the original ones---in such a way that the loss of "information" is minimized.

```{r fig-3-3, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.cap='Dimension reduction or minimization of "information loss"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure-3-3.png")
```

The new variables (i.e. vectors) are searched for in a way that they are as close as possible (as much correlated) to the set of original variables.

The solution is obtained with the vector $\Psi$ of $n$ elements that maximizes the function \@ref(eq:37)

\begin{equation}
max \sum_{j} cor^{2} (\boldsymbol{\Psi}, \mathbf{x_j})
(\#eq:37)
\end{equation}

In other words, we look for a new variable that is the "closest" to the set of original variables. This will provide a first common factor; the rest of the factors are obtained with the same condition but orthogonal to the directions previously obtained.

Often, the first factor is highly correlated with all the variables. This indicates the so-called _size factor_, which we have discussed in detail in section \@ref(size-factor).

The size factor can be considered as an overall summary, or synthesis, of the entire set of variables. We can compare the first factor with the average of all the original variables, and confirm that they are very similar.

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{p} (\mathbf{x_1} + \mathbf{x_2} + \dots + \mathbf{x_p}) \approx \boldsymbol{\Psi_1}
(\#eq:38)
\end{equation}

```{r table-3-9, echo = FALSE}
# table_3_9
table_3_9 <- read.csv('data/table-3-9.csv', check.names = FALSE)

knitr::kable(
  table_3_9,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Coefficients of the first principal component (i.e. size factor) from first PCA analysis.'
)
```

```{r fig-3-4, echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='Size Factor of active variables'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure-3-4.png")
```

The data set about the international cities provide an example of how to find an _index of mean salary per city_. The components of the unit axis give the linear combination of the original variables (mean-centered and reduced). This is the linear combination of the first principal component, namely, the desired index of mean salaries (see table \@ref(tab:table-2-3)).

A common application of PCA is to build synthetic indices. For instance, a quality index of a given product made from several characteristics of the product. A common example in psychometrics has to do with indices that define a general aptitude factor: e.g. verbal aptitude, or math aptitude. Also in economics, we often find indices of economic capacity for a certain region or city.

Sometimes there is no clear definition of the desired index, but rather a vague notion od the aspects that such an index may comprise. In these cases, the analysts must pay careful attention to collect reliable data, with indicators of the desired index, ideally with highly correlated variables. The computed index (or a first approximation) will be determined by the first principal component of the gathered data.



## Handling Missing Values

With real data, it is common to have individuals for which one or more variable measurements are missing. For example, in a survey about quality of housing, an interviewee may not feel like answering a question about the number of bathrooms in his/her house. Or the same interviewee may not recall the value of the area of the house.
In order to have an idea of the amount of missing values, it is recommended to count the number of missing values per individual. In any case, given a data matrix with missing values, we should have a policy about to handle them.

A first approach to take care of missing values consists of removing the individuals with missing data before performing a PCA. Obviously, this solution implies losing several individuals, which could be detrimental for the overall quality of the calculated results.

Another approach involves replacing the missing values with an estimation. This approach is typically known as _imputing_ missing values.

Keep in mind that PCA relies on the analysis of the dispersion in the individuals around the center of gravity. When we don't have information about an individul, a prudent decision is to locate that individual in the center of the cloud. By doing this, we don't privilege any direction of dispersion.

This gives us a first basic rule to handle missing data. We substitute an individual's missing value by the mean of the variable for which there's no available information. This works as lon as the amount of missing data for that given variable is small.

Of course, more refined imputation procedures can be devised. This usually depends on the degree of knowledge about the phenomenon under study. For example, if we have an old adult male farmer for which his income is missing, we could estimate this value with the average of the incomes in this category.

Notice that we could also use the results of the PCA to _fine tune_ (in a non-parametric optimization way) the estimation of a missing values. The rationale behind this approach is based on the reconstitution formula \@ref(eq:35) to approximate the data. Under this procedure, we can estimate the value of the $ij$-th cell with the $q$ first factors.



## PCA and Cluster Analysis

__Work in progress__



## Data Weighing

In PCA, the weights of the individuals affect the calculation of the means, the covariances, and the correlations.

$$
cov(x_j, x_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \hspace{1mm} (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_j) (x_{ik} - \bar{x}_k)
$$

In general, all the individuals of a data table have the same weight. Consequently, the analysis focuses on the description of the individuals without privileging any of them.

However, if what we are interested in is describing the population (and not just the sample), we should determine whether the sample can be made more representative by reweighing the individuals. 
Notice that in this case, the visual displays and the interpretations are conditioned by the appropriateness of the weights: we go from a purely descriptive context with an unweighted analysis, to a more delicate inferencial context.

In any case, the weights of the individuals should not vary drastically. Put it another way, the reweighing is done to refine the estimations, not to create them in an exclusive form (it is a good habit to assess the variability of the weights by looking at their histogram).

We should also highlight the possibility of using the weights to study the _stability_ of the PCA results. This can be done with the bootstrap method with a system of weights ($p_i$ = 0 or 1 or 2, etc, $\sum p_i = n$). Alternatively, we can also use a more classic system of weights ($p_i > 0$; $\sum p_i = n$).

_Note_: we can modify an active individual into a supplementary individual by assigning it a weight of zero.



## PCA as an Intermediate Analytical Stage

Working with the first principal components provides a handful of advantages: 1) the principal components are orthogonal; 2) the random variability part is minimized; 3) the components provide an optimal dimensionality reduction; and 4) calculating the distances between individuals is simplified.

Often, a problem involves modeling a certain response variable $\mathbf{y}$, in term of a series of explanatory variables. When the response variable is a quantitative variable we talk about _regression_ models. In turn, we talk about _classification_ when the response variables is of categorical nature.

One common issue when modeling a response variable---with a regression or classfication technique---has to do with _multicollinearity_ in the explanatory variables. Geometrically, the subspace spanned by the explanatory variables is unstable. This means that small variations in the values of the variables will result in large changes on the spanned subspace.

Performing a regression analysis involves projecting the response variable onto the subspace spanned by the explanatory variables. If two explanatory variables are highly correlated, small variations in these variables will substantially modify the orientation of the space. And consequently, the projectino $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ becomes unstable (see figure \@ref(fig:fig-3-8))

```{r fig-3-8, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.cap='Orthogonal projection of y onto the plane spanned by two explanatory variables x'}

```

In this situation, and with more than two variables, it can be interesting to use the principal components obtained on the data table $\mathbf{X}$ formed by the explanatory variables. More specifically, we can keep those components for which their eigenvalues are sufficiently different from zero.

Because the principal components are expressed as linear combinations of the explanatory variables, we can use the components to define the projection subspace for the response variable.

By using only the first principal components, we reduce the random variability in the data. Therefore we can say that the data have been "smoothed".

One is left with the operation to undo the change given by using the components. That is, we need to express the response variable in terms of the original variables. Each principal component is written as a linear combination of the explanatory variables:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y} = b_0 + b_1 \Psi_1 + \dots + b_p \Psi_p = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \mathbf{x_1} + \dots + \hat{\beta}_p \mathbf{x_p}
(\#eq:39)
\end{equation}

The principal components in this case become _instrumental_ variables. This means that theur behave like intemediate links for a another subsequent analysis.

We can select the principal components that will be part of a given model. One way to do this is by selecting them with the Furnival-Wilson (1974) algorithm to obtain the best regression equations. In fact, the problem is much simpler given that the factors are orthogonal.

An analogous situation occurs within a classification context. As a particular case, the discriminant analysis of two groups is equivalent to a regression analysis. In this case, we can have a preliminary selection of those principal components with the most discriminant power.



## Comparing Various Tables

Consider a study in which we observe a group of individuals measured by a set of variables. Moreover, suppose that we repeat the study at different time periods, and that we are interested in looking at the evoution of such measurements over time. A study like this will provide several data tables of the same dimension (e.g. one table per time period). Obviously, one of the analytical goals has to do with comparing such tables.

One possible way to compare the tables is to take one of the data tables as the active variables, while the rest of tables are treated as supplementary variables. For example, we can take the first table as the reference table; or also the last table. Likewise, we can take the mean table and use it as a benchmark to compare all the tables against with: the mean table is the active one, and all the other tables become supplementary.

```{r fig-3-8, echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='Comparison of two tables.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/figure-3-9.png")
```

In the example of the international cities, we have the same study performed at two points in time: 1991 and 1994. So far we have used only the 1994 table. However, we can use the table from 1991. The only difference is that some cities are not included in 1991: Manama, Prague, Budapest, Abu Dhabi, and Bangkok.

We have decided to consolidate both tables into a single one: by stacking both tables by columns. Doing this allows us to consider those cities from 1991 as supplemetary individuals, and then project them on the results from the analysis of the 1994 table.

The axes of this analysis are those defined in the analysis of the 1994 table. The first axis is related with the income inequality. In turn, the second axis is related with the oposition of the salaries of qualified manual labor, versus the salaries of managers and employees in the sector of services.

In this plane we project the the cities in terms of their salaries from 1991. Then, the movement of the cities suggests a greater salary inequality
