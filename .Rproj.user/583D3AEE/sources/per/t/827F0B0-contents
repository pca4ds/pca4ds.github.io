# Application Examples

Principal Component Analysis can be applied to a wide array of disciplines
and fields of application. Some of the fields in which we have had the 
opportunity to use PCA include Public Administration, Sociology, Marketing, 
Quality Control, to mention but a few. In this chapter, we present some 
applications of PCA to various case studies. These examples seek to give you an 
idea of the possibilities and scope of PCA under diverse circumstances.


## Lascaux Cave Temperatures {#lascaux}

Our first example has to do with temperatures in the famous 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux" target="_blank">Lascaux Cave</a>.
This grotto is a complex of caves located in the department of Dordogne in 
southwestern France. The cave contains over 600 parietal wall paintings, 
depicting large animals (e.g. bulls, bisons, ibexes, rhinoceros) from the Upper 
Paleolithic time period.

The control of environmental variables (e.g. temperatures measured in distinct 
places, hydrometry measurements, etc.) in Lascaux cave was done in a manual 
fashion decades ago. The measurements involved daily readings of 77 different
locations in the cave. From these readings, a technical operator in charge
of the machines instaled in the cave, controled the settings in order to 
guarantee adequate environmental conditions for the conservation of the paintings.

In the late 1970s, it was acknowledged that a less manual and time consuming work 
for controling the environment conditions in the cave had to be implemented. 
The institution responsible to develop an automatic temperature controling 
system was the _Laboratoire de Recherche des Monuments Historiques_ LRMH 
(research laboratory of historical momuments). One of the stages in this 
research project involved deciding whether to locate the sensors for reading 
temperatures along the cave.

We use a temperature data set that was part of this reserach project. The 
purpose is to see in what way PCA can be applied in order to describe the 
evolution of the cave temperatures, in terms of the reading positions, and 
the date of such readings. We seek to obtain a description that allows us
to better understand the environment conditions of the cave. As part of this 
analysis, we'll see how looking for optimal regressions enable us to select a 
minimum number of temperature points that capture as much of the 
information as possible needed to control the temperature conditions of the cave. 


### Temperature Data

The data of this section have to do with temperatures collected in 30 different 
locations along the cave, observed over 482 days, between February 1981 and 
December 1982. The following diagram shows the location of the measurements
inside the cave. Each label involves a thermometer, installed either on the rock,
or outside.
